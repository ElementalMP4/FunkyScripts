# Funky Scripts

A series of Visual Basic Scripts designed to do irritating things on Windows computers

NOTE: Although none of these scripts are harmful, don't put them on anyone's computers because that's cringe

### Installing the scripts in the most irritating way possible

1) Open up Windows Run (win + r)
2) Type in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
3) Put the scripts in the folder

### Stopping them when they get out of hand

1) Open up a new powershell window
2) Type in `stop-process -name wscript`
3) Open up Windows Run (win + r)
4) Type in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
5) Delete the scripts from the folder
